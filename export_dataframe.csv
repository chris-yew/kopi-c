https://vulcanpost.com//704552/how-much-degree-renovate-house-singapore/,"It almost sounds formulaic but this has been the norm for many Singaporeans.While having a degree doesn’t necessarily mean job stability, it can help pave the way for a comfortable life.With Singapore’s strong focus on sophisticated skill sets to drive the economy, a degree may simply serve as an added protection against competition in an increasingly globalised world.In fact, according to data from SingStat, Singapore residents aged 25 years and above with a university education consists of 23.7 per cent of the entire local population in 2010, and that figure has increased to 31.6 per cent in 2018.If you are thinking of getting a degree, the estimated course fees at the local universities (both public and private institutions) range between S$24,600 and S$39,600 for Singaporeans if we look at the latest numbers from the 2020 intake.These are estimations based on three-year general courses, and exclude the more expensive courses like medicine, dentistry and music.If you are thinking of studying overseas however, the tuition fees are generally more costly and you will also have to consider accommodation and other living expenses.At this point, you may want to consider getting an Education Loan at a low interest rate of 4.5 per cent and with flexible repayment options, whether you would like to study at a local private institution or overseas institution.How much you would need to get a degree: At least S$25,000Instead of being a salaried employee, there are some Singaporeans who yearn to start their own business and be their own boss.The basics of starting a business is to first identify a consumer pain point before coming up with a product or service that helps to resolve it and meet their needs.Let’s say you are planning to set up an IT software startup.
Of course, you can choose to do away with some of these costs such as opting for remote working to save on office costs, or undertake some of the paperwork yourself to reduce expenses.This calculator from the Economic Development Board (EDB) is a helpful tool that lets you have a rough idea of what you need to consider before setting up your company.How much you would need to start a business: Up to S$252,000A wedding in Singapore typically costs somewhere between S$30,000 and S$50,000, though extravagant weddings can cost significantly more (i.e. more than S$100,000).The biggest components are the wedding banquet, bridal package and honeymoon.
It does not mean that you have a cash flow problem — in fact, it helps you to have better cash flow management so that you wouldn’t find your savings depleted suddenly.Many might not know this, but the cost of borrowing via a personal loan is lower than a credit card interest charge (typically 25 per cent per annum)."

https://vulcanpost.com//701856/staffany-cico-app-singapore/,"Backed by NUS Enterprise, StaffAny specialises in enterprise software that helps businesses schedule staff, lets staff apply for leave easily, provides an on-site clock, smart timesheets and helps managers generate reports in real-time.Their clientele ranges from big chains such as Ippudo Ramen, Pezzo Group and Pandora to multi-outlet concepts such as Foreword Coffee and Tadcaster Hospitality, to fast-growing companies such as Wafuken and Populous Cafe.After COVID-19 struck Singapore, the entire nation had to go into a semi-lockdown and only essential services were allowed to continue their operations.Some of their clients brought up their pain points regarding the safe management measures.
“This came about through customer conversations, when we realised how worrying it is for business owners who are unsure if staff have clocked-in with SafeEntry and logged their temperatures,” said co-founder Eugene Ng.They then requested the StaffAny team to build a solution to alleviate their concerns.
The StaffAny team thought of a contactless way to allow employees to clock in and out, record their temperatures and make health declarations while minimising physical contact: a mobile app.The team spent about four weeks developing the app and pushed out an initial version about one and a half weeks after the SafeEntry requirements came into force.Called CICO (short for Clock-In, Clock-Out), the app combines elements of the StaffAny workforce management solution, which digitalises attendance process and other key information records for hourly workers into remotely accessible dashboards, with the government’s SafeEntry digital check-in system.The app automatically redirects users to the SafeEntry website to input the required contact tracing information and sends them reminder notifications if they have not done so.To support Singapore in its reopening, we have extended our offerings to include keying-in of temperatures and health declaration forms.For companies that have employees working from home, they also make use of the CICO app as a means to keep track of their employees’ working hours.
“Due to COVID-19, they wanted to switch to a contactless attendance system to minimise physical contact of their staff members,” said Eugene.“They then implemented CICO and switched out of biometric systems quickly so that they can eliminate the need for employees to touch common surfaces on punch-card machines and biometric systems.”Cedele, Ippudo Ramen, Pandora and other firms have also implemented the CICO app.
To resolve this, the team has been conducting group webinars on a weekly basis to educate them on how the app works — which could be easily set up within 20 minutes.StaffAny is currently working with GovTech to join the SafeEntry programme, and this partnership will hopefully help them develop deeper integrations of the CICO software.The pandemic serves as a catalyst for digital transformation for many SMEs, starting with small steps like adopting the use of workforce management solutions like CICO."
https://vulcanpost.com//703896/ge-2020-spores-electoral-campaign-guidelines-and-how-theyve-been-broken/,"Here is a quick reminder of what parties can and cannot do to get your vote— and a roundup of the times when candidates crossed the line during GE 2020.Politicians typically campaign by:Each candidate can open one election office per polling district within a radius of 200m from any polling station.Decorative items bearing plagues such as clothing, buttons, and umbrellas are not considered election advertising.Electoral ethics advises against:While it is unclear what words or actions constitute a violation of electoral ethics, several incidents held during GE 2020 may have flouted these guidelines.Raeesah Khan, the Workers Party (WP) candidate for Sengkang GRC submitted a public apology after two police reports were filed against her for inciting racial and religious discord in old Facebook posts.The People’s Action Party (PAP) has been reported on the same charges after it published a blog post calling for Raeesah’s candidature to be revoked.The report stated that the PAP had falsely accused her of making “highly derogatory statements about Chinese and Christians.”The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) has also been issued a Corrections Notice for making false claims under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).The order was issued after SDP accused the PAP of making plans to increase Singapore’s population to 10 million.The SDP maintains that its statements are credible and has announced that it will be applying for a cancellation of the Correction Order.On July 6, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong stated that opposition parties “have been completely silent on how to tackle Covid-19 during the last six months, and in this election campaign.”In response, several parties have countered with reiterations of the policies set forth to ameliorate medical and socio-economic problems created by Covid-19 stated in their manifestos.This selection of incidents number among the many which seem to have flouted ethical guidelines this electoral season.It remains unknown whether mechanisms to investigate unethical campaigning will be activated once Polling Day is over.Should:Should not:On 2 July, the People’s Solidarity Party (PSP) took down over 50 posters along Clementi West which infringed on public safety."

https://vulcanpost.com//704096/everything-you-need-to-know-about-red-dot-united/,"In this series, we will cover everything you need to know about the party so you can have a better understanding of what they’re about before you cast your votes.Following our breakdown of the other political parties in Singapore, we take a look at Singapore’s youngest opposition party, Red Dot United (RDU), in the last part of our series.
Red Dot United was founded in May 2020 by former Progress Singapore Party members Ravi Philemon and Michelle Lee, together with other former members of other political parties.
Red Dot United has been advocating freedom of expression and being “captains of their own lives and families”, which is pertinent in Singapore where Singaporeans have expressed that the ruling party has the main say on the country’s policies.On their Facebook page, they have been championing their vision to be the Singaporean’s voice in Parliament.For Singaporeans, they see the RDU as another venue to contest the policies rolled out by ruling party PAP.
It helps to have another listening ear and voice from the opposition side.The members of RDU include people from all walks of life, and Ravi has added that they would be inviting Singaporeans from all walks of life to join the party.“We are not an elite political party."
https://vulcanpost.com//704136/peoples-voice-party-2020-manifesto-singapore/,"In a 19-minute long Facebook video released yesterday (July 6), PV founder and Secretary-General Lim Tean detailed five key policies that the party would push for if elected: Restoring jobs to Singaporeans is touted as the centrepiece of the PV’s manifesto.
Lim said that the returning of one’s Central Provident Fund (CPF) monies at age 55 is a policy that the party has been pushing for since its inception in 2018.
This would allow Singaporeans to receive a higher rate of return on their CPF, preventing them from struggling in their old age.The PV is pushing for fundamental reforms of immigration policies.Many Singaporeans feel like they are “aliens in their own country”, said the party.
Even though Singapore is the most expensive city in the world for five years running, Singaporeans are still struggling with the cost of living, said the party."
